# HOW TO INSTALL:
**IMPORTANT!**

Mod installation is irreversible, make a copy of your elements\industries folder aside (in an other folder outside the game folder).

## Client side(only):

Download the seven zip files and store them in the same folder (all 7 of them are needed to unpack).

Unpack "myDU client Tier Industries Textures mod pack.zip" and replace all files into the client folder at:     

My Dual Universe\Game\data\resources_generated\elements\


# CONTENT:

Zip file (150mo) contains asset redirection entries toward existing models located in the client original folders, and new textures.

Textures are all *.png format, lighter and easier to modify.





Enjoy!
